# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction 🏥💰

This project predicts **medical insurance charges** using machine learning.  
The dataset (`insurance.csv`) contains demographic and lifestyle information such as **age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions and categorical feature counts.
- Preprocessed categorical features (sex, smoker, region) into numerical values.
- Built a **Linear Regression Model** to predict insurance charges.
- Evaluated the model using **regression performance metrics**.
